# Aircraft_dynamics
Fixed wing, subsonic, aircraft design software designed to provide an end to end solution for solving basic aircraft calualations.

The intent is to provide an extensible library that can solve basic aircraft calculations.   A wrapper program is provided to open an Excel file 
containing basic aircraft design information, store the data in memory in a standard format and execute the library in the order that is required.   
All data is written back to the data array in RAM. Eventually, a report writer will be added as well as a design rule checker for the aircraft.

Please see the attached description: Aircraft_dynamics_220901.pdf for more explanation of the program.
